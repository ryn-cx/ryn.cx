## Overview

Full stack, modern web application template. Using FastAPI, React, SQLModel, PostgreSQL, Docker, GitHub Actions, automatic HTTPS and more. The template structure follows FastAPI Best Practices and the project structure seen in professional FastAPI web applications such as NEtflix's dispatch.

## Why

FastAPI has an official template that uses a lot of practices that do not match the best practices used by most companies, this project is an alternative that more closely match the structure used in professional developer environments. This template has all of the features from the official template plus a handful of optional extra features not available in the official template.


## How Does It Work?

This project started as a fork of the official template which was then heavily modified to create this template. For more information on the technology behind the template check the Github page for a complete list of information.
