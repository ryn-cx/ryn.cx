## Overview

An automatic real time backup and versioning system written in Go. It will automatically
monitor a folder for changes and any time a change is detected it will copy all of the
files into a timestamped folder.

## Why

There is already existing software that will do what this project does. I just created
it because I thought it would be an easy project to learn how to make a GUI for a
desktop application in Go.

## How Does It Work?

The entire program is written in Go. The frontend was created using wails.
