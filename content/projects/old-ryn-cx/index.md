## Overview

Old placeholder website that used Three.js to create a fun and interesting 3D logo with moving lights that is mesmerizing to watch.

## Why

There wasn't much purpose behind this. I wanted to put a placeholder on this domain, and making a fun little project in Three.js sounded like the perfect thing to do.

## How Did It Work?

Everything was made in Three.js.
